Use runsim.m to execute simulation

1.Main program files include

computeStaticTorque.m
controller.m
inverse_kinematics.m
jacobian.m
manipulatorDynamics.m
manipulator_pos.m

2. Additional files

model.m : This is the MAIN script where the symbolic derivation of all required objects are done.
The symbolically derived files are then exported into helper functions automatically using the matlab symbolic exporter 'matlabFunction.m'. 

3. The autogenerated helper files are:
gravity.m
coriolis.m 
ikin.m 
inertia.m
jac.m
link_jacs.m
Note: These files are not readable as they have been autogenerated.
